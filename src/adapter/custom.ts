/**
 * Custom adapter loader.
 *
 * When a user's `registry-shell.config.ts` sets `adapter: "./my-adapter"`, the
 * shell calls `loadCustomAdapterOverrides(resolved)` to resolve that module
 * and extract method overrides. The overrides are then shallow-merged on top
 * of the default convention-based adapter's methods.
 *
 * The user's module should default-export one of:
 *   • A factory `(resolved) => Partial<AdapterMethods>` — preferred. Gets the
 *     resolved config so it can build paths against `resolved.paths`, decide
 *     based on `resolved.root`, etc.
 *   • A plain `Partial<AdapterMethods>` object — also accepted for simple
 *     static overrides that don't need the resolved config.
 *
 * Only the methods a user supplies are taken; any method they omit falls
 * through to the built-in default. That means you can override just
 * `getAllComponents` to serve from a database and keep convention-based
 * doc/registry-item loading for the rest.
 *
 * Loaded via jiti so the user can write the adapter in TypeScript without
 * their own build step — same approach we use for the config file itself.
